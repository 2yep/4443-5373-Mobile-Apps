Using Expo CLI instead of React Native CLI can offer several benefits, especially if you're new to React Native or looking for a more streamlined development experience. Here are some key advantages of using Expo CLI:

### 1. **Ease of Setup and Use**
- **Simplified Setup**: Expo abstracts away much of the complexity involved in setting up a native development environment. It manages dependencies and configuration for you, reducing initial setup time and effort.
- **No Native Code Configuration Needed**: With Expo, you don't have to interact directly with Xcode or Android Studio for basic projects. This is particularly beneficial for developers who are more focused on JavaScript than native development.

### 2. **Rapid Development and Prototyping**
- **Hot Reloading and Live Updating**: Expo supports hot reloading and live updating, allowing you to see changes instantly on your testing devices or emulators.
- **Expo Go App for Testing**: The Expo Go app on iOS and Android lets you immediately run your project on a real device without needing to build and install it each time, which is excellent for rapid prototyping.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Development**
- **Uniform API**: Expo provides a uniform API that works across both iOS and Android, simplifying the development process.
- **Wide Range of Pre-built Components**: Expo comes with a set of pre-built components that are ready to use, reducing the need to rely on third-party libraries.

### 4. **Ease of Deployment**
- **Publishing Made Easy**: Expo simplifies the process of publishing your app to the App Store and Google Play. It can handle the packaging and some aspects of submission, which can be particularly helpful for those new to mobile app publishing.

### 5. **Strong Community and Ecosystem**
- **Community Support**: Expo has a large and active community, which means plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party plugins are available.
- **Regular Updates**: Expo is regularly updated with improvements and support for the latest React Native features.

### 6. **Built-in Services and Tools**
- **Expo SDK**: Comes with a rich set of APIs and modules (like camera, geolocation, notifications) which can be easily integrated into your app.
- **Updates Over the Air (OTA)**: Allows you to push updates to your users' devices without having to go through the app store submission process each time.

### Considerations
- **Limitations in Native Module Support**: Expo doesn't support all native modules, so if your project requires custom native code, you might eventually need to "eject" to bare React Native (which Expo supports).
- **Ejection**: If you outgrow Expo or need more control, you can eject your project to a standard React Native setup, but this process can be complex.

Overall, Expo is an excellent choice for developers prioritizing ease of use, rapid development, and who do not require extensive native module customization. It's particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized projects and for those who are just starting with React Native.
