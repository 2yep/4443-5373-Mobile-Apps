Hey there,

Thank you for downloading the book, youll find two options in this folder, the book version 1.x will hold the app build with Ionic 3.

The book version 4.x will hold the same content but for Ionic 4 and Firebase 5.3+ and Capacitor

HAPPY CODING!


The source code for the app we’ll build together: [Event Manager](Apphttps://github.com/javebratt/event-tutorial-v4/)

An [authentication starter template](https://github.com/javebratt/ionic-auth-email-firebase-sdk), you can clone it, run npm install and you’ll already have an app with a working authentication system.
