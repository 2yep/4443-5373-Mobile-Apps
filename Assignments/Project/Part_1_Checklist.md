### A (Project Overview):

- This document should contain anything information showing an organized project. 
- This document should be a one or two pages. 
- Some examples of information might be:
    - List of teams, team members, and team assignments.
    - Links to the project repo, firebase, and any other pertinent information dealing with the project.
- github usernames and emails

### B (Core Components)
    Firestore, location, social media, friends, geotagging, etc.

### C (Use Cases)

- Use cases are simple statements implying what a user or "customer" expects from your app.
- You should start with general use cases:
    - Joe wants to see where his friends are on a map so he can go hang out.
    - Joe wants to be able to ask someone to be his friend on the app.
    - Joe wants to be able to upload images with tags and location.
- Then you can create more specific ones for each component, as well as make them more developer centric. 
    - Location Page needs a method to get users current location.
    - Image upload page needs a method to get users current location. 
- Your Firestore service will largely depend on your use cases.

### D (Next Steps)

- Determine what you will show to class on Wednesday. Short presentation of progress (3 min and up).
- Create or show me what development tools your using to organize project (e.g kan ban board).
- Determine what portions of app will be due when (deliverable dates).
- Find some tool (like a slack integration) to show user participation and progress.
- Part 2 of the project will be based on this discussion.
