## Getting Started

To get started install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform. The Node Package Manager is included in the Node.js distribution. Open a new terminal (command prompt) and check that `node` and `npm` (node package manager) actually exist.

> Tip: To test that you've got Node.js correctly installed on your computer, open a new terminal and type node --help and you should see the usage documentation.
